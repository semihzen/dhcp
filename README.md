# DHCP EXAMPLE


### While creating this topology, I learned how DHCP works, how it should be configured, and, at the same time, I used Wireshark capture to examine the messages exchanged between the client and DHCP server. It might look like a simple DHCP topology, but it helped me gain a lot of information about DHCP. I discovered that automatic IP assignment creates significantly less workload compared to manual IP assignment. By capturing the messages such as request, offer, ack, and discover using Wireshark, I learned more about these messages. Additionally, I benefited from static routing and VLAN design while creating this topology. Below is the photo of my topology.
